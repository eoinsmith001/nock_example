# Using nock when testing a component which hits an api

Contains: 
  - namesvc: a simple express restful api which accepts GET and POST to /name endpoint
  - nock_test: a single module wrapping a request to namesvc (which returns a Promise), and a mocha test

## Run

Start the namesvc

```
cd namesvc
npm install
nodemon server.sh
# validate endpoints
curl -X GET localhost:3001/name
curl -X POST localhost:3001/name
# note the morgan logging generated by the app (http requests are being received)
```

Now run the mocha test, in which the call to namesvc is nocked

```
cd nock_test
npm install
mocha
```

- Read `nock_test/test/test.js`, see that the expectation is that the fake nock response is indeed generated by the call to the method which hits the API.
- Note that no morgan logging is generated in the namesvc
- Most convincingly, the mocha test works even if the namesvc is stopped

## Extra detail

Activate verbose logging for nock by setting environment variable `DEBUG`

```
cd nock_test
DEBUG=nock.* mocha
```
